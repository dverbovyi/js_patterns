    SINGLETON
    
-Intent

    * Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global points of access to it
    * Encapsulated 'just-in-time initialization' or 'initialization on first use'
    
-Problem

    Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object. Additionally,
    lazy initialization and global access are necessary.  
      
-Solution

    Make the class of the single instance object responsible for creation, 
    initialization, access, and enforcement. Declare the instance as a private 
    static data member. Provide a public static member function that encapsulates 
    all initialization code, and provides access to the instance.
    
    The client calls the accessor function (using the class name and scope resolution
    operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is required.
    
    Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following criteria are 
    satisfied:
    
    - Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
    - Lazy initialization is desirable
    - Global access is not otherwise provided for
    - If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization occurs, and 
    global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently interesting.
    
    The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an application-specific
    number of instances.
    
    The "static member function accessor" approach will not support subclassing of 
    the Singleton class. If subclassing is desired, refer to the discussion in the 
    book.
